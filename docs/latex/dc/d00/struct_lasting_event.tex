\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents up-\/to-\/date information about some condition or state of an external entity that updates in real-\/time. 

For example, a \doxylink{class_quote}{Quote} is an up-\/to-\/date information about best bid and best offer for a specific symbol.

Lasting events are conflated for each symbol. Last event for each symbol is always delivered to event listeners on subscription, but intermediate (next-\/to-\/last) events are not queued anywhere, they are simply discarded as stale events. More recent events represent an up-\/to-\/date information about some external entity.

Lasting events can be used with DXFeed\+::get\+Last\+Event() and DXFeed\+::get\+Last\+Events methods to retrieve last events for each symbol.

Note, that subscription to all lasting events of a specific type via \doxylink{struct_wildcard_symbol_acf6b6b4eeecdb9cca6e311ed7db387f6}{Wildcard\+Symbol\+::\+ALL} symbol object does not benefit from the above advantages of lasting events.
