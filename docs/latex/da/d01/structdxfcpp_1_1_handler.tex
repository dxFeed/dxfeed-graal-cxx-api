\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename Signature$>$\newline
struct dxfcpp\+::\+Handler$<$ Signature $>$}
A thread-\/safe class that allows to asynchronously notify listeners with a given signature. 

Listeners can be any callable entities. Listeners are placed in a future. Within one batch, listeners will be called sequentially. Futures are placed in a circular buffer and executed asynchronously.

If you need synchronous execution of listeners, but it was possible to execute them in another thread, then limit the buffer size to one.
