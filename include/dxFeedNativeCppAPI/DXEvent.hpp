/**
 * <h3><a name="eventFlagsSection">Event flags, transactions and snapshots</a></h3>
 *
 * Some indexed event sources provide a consistent view of a set of events for a given symbol. Their updates
 * may incorporate multiple changes that have to be processed at the same time.
 * The corresponding information is carried in @ref IndexedEvent::getEventFlags() "eventFlags" property.
 *
 * <p> The value of @ref IndexedEvent::getEventFlags() "eventFlags" property has several significant bits that are
 * packed into an integer in the following way:
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 *    31..7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
 * +---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 * |         | SM |    | SS | SE | SB | RE | TX |
 * +---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 * </tt></pre>
 *
 * Each source updates its transactional state using these bits separately.
 * The state of each source has to be tracked separately in a map for each source.
 * However, event @ref IndexedEvent::getIndex() "index" is unique across the sources. This is achieved by allocating
 * an event-specific number of most significant bits of @ref IndexedEvent::getIndex() "index" for use as
 * a @ref IndexedEvent::getSource() "source" @ref IndexedEventSource::id() "id".
 *
 * <p> `TX` (bit 0) &mdash; ::TX_PENDING is an indicator of pending transactional update.
 * It can be retrieved from `eventFlags` with the following piece of code:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * bool txPending = (event-> getEventFlags() & IndexedEvent::TX_PENDING) != 0;
 * ```
 *
 * <p>When `txPending` is `true` it means, that an ongoing transaction update that spans multiple events is
 * in process. All events with `txPending` `true` shall be put into a separate <em>pending list</em>
 * for each source id and should be processed later when an event for this source id with `txPending` `false` comes.
 *
 * <p> `RE` (bit 1) &mdash; ::REMOVE_EVENT is used to indicate that that the event with the
 * corresponding index has to be removed.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * bool removeEvent = (event-> getEventFlags() & IndexedEvent::REMOVE_EVENT) != 0;
 * ```
 *
 * <p> `SB` (bit 2) &mdash; ::SNAPSHOT_BEGIN is used to indicate when the loading of a snapshot starts.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * bool snapshotBegin = (event-> getEventFlags() & IndexedEvent::SNAPSHOT_BEGIN) != 0;
 * ```
 *
 * <p> Snapshot load starts on new subscription and the first indexed event that arrives for each non-zero source id
 * on new subscription may have `snapshotBegin` set to `true`. It means, that an ongoing snapshot
 * consisting of multiple events is incoming. All events for this source id shall be put into a separate
 * <em>pending list</em> for each source id.
 *
 * <p> `SE` (bit 3) &mdash; ::SNAPSHOT_END or `SS` (bit 4) &mdash; ::SNAPSHOT_SNIP are used to indicate the end of a
 * snapshot.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * bool snapshotEnd = (event-> getEventFlags() & IndexedEvent::SNAPSHOT_END) != 0;
 * bool snapshotSnip = (event-> getEventFlags() & IndexedEvent::SNAPSHOT_SNIP) != 0;
 * ```
 *
 * <p>The last event of a snapshot is marked with either `snapshotEnd` or `snapshotSnip`. At this time, all events
 * from a <em>pending list</em> for the corresponding source can be processed, unless `txPending` is also
 * set to `true`. In the later case, the processing shall be further delayed due to ongoing transaction.
 *
 * <p>The difference between `snapshotEnd` and `snapshotSnip` is the following.
 * `snapshotEnd` indicates that the data source had sent all the data pertaining to the subscription
 * for the corresponding indexed event, while `snapshotSnip` indicates that some limit on the amount
 * of data was reached and while there still might be more data available, it will not be provided.
 *
 * <p> `SM` (bit 6) &mdash; ::SNAPSHOT_MODE is used to instruct dxFeed to use snapshot mode.
 * It is intended to be used only for publishing to activate (if not yet activated) snapshot mode.
 * The difference from ::SNAPSHOT_BEGIN flag is that ::SNAPSHOT_MODE only switches on snapshot mode
 * without starting snapshot synchronization protocol.
 *
 * <p> When a snapshot is empty or consists of a single event, then the event can have both `snapshotBegin`
 * and `snapshotEnd` or `snapshotSnip` flags. In case of an empty snapshot, `removeEvent` on this event is
 * also set to `true`.

 * and their @ref #getSource() "source" is always @ref IndexedEventSource::DEFAULT "DEFAULT".
 *
 * Unlike a general IndexedEvent that is subscribed to via DXFeedSubscription} using a plain symbol to receive all
 * events for all indices, time-series events are typically subscribed to using TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol class to
 * specific time range of the subscription. There is a dedicated DXFeedTimeSeriesSubscription class that is designed
 * to simplify the task of subscribing for time-series events.
 *
 * TimeSeriesEventModel class handles all the snapshot and transaction logic and conveniently represents a list of
 * current time-series events ordered by their @ref ::getTime() "time". It relies on the code
 * of AbstractIndexedEventModel to handle this logic.
 * Use the source code of AbstractIndexedEventModel for clarification on transactions and snapshot logic.
 *
 * Classes that implement this interface may also implement LastingEvent interface, which makes it possible to use
 * DXFeed::getLastEvent() method to retrieve the last event for the corresponding symbol.
 *
 * <h3>Publishing time-series</h3>
 *
 * When publishing time-series event with DXPublisher::publishEvents() method on incoming TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol
 * the snapshot of currently known events for the requested time range has to be published first.
 *
 * A snapshot is published in the <em>descending</em> order of @ref ::getIndex() "index" (which is the same as the
 * descending order of @ref ::getTime() "time"), starting with an event with the largest index and marking it
 * with ::SNAPSHOT_BEGIN bit in @ref ::getEventFlags "eventFlags". All other event follow with default, zero
 * @ref ::getEventFlags() "eventFlags". If there is no actual event at the time that was specified in subscription
 * @ref TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol::getFromTime() "fromTime" property, then event with the corresponding time
 * has to be created anyway and published. To distinguish it from the actual event, it has to be marked with
 * ::REMOVE_EVENT bit in @ref ::getEventFlags() "eventFlags". ::SNAPSHOT_END bit in this event's
 * @ref #getEventFlags() "eventFlags" s optional during publishing. It will be properly set on receiving end anyway.
 * Note, that publishing any event with time that is below subscription
 * @ref TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol::getFromTime() "fromTime" also works as a legal indicator for the end of the
 * snapshot.
 *
 * Both TimeAndSale and Candle time-series events define a sequence property that is mixed into an
 * @ref ::getIndex() "index" property. It provides a way to distinguish different events at the same time. For a
 * snapshot end event the sequence has to be left at its default zero value. It means, that if there is an actual
 * event to be published at subscription @ref TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol::getFromTime() "fromTime" with non-zero
 * sequence, then generation of an additional snapshot end event with the subscription
 * @ref TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol::getFromTime() "fromTime" and zero sequence is still required.

     * kind of a sequence number.
