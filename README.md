This package provides access to [dxFeed market data](https://dxfeed.com/market-data/).
The library is built as a language-specific wrapper over
the [dxFeed Graal Native](https://dxfeed.jfrog.io/artifactory/maven-open/com/dxfeed/graal-native-api/) library,
which was compiled with [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/)
and [dxFeed Java API](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/overview-summary.html) (our flagman API).

:information_source: If you already use [dxFeed C  API](https://github.com/dxFeed/dxfeed-c-api), please see
the [Overview](#overview) section.<br>
:warning: It’s an **alpha** version and still under active development. **Don’t use it in a production environment.**

## Overview

### Reasons for the New C/C++ API Repository

The old version of [dxFeed C API](https://github.com/dxFeed/dxfeed-c-api), has several [architectural restrictions](#architectural-restrictions-and-other-limitations-of-the-old-version)
that prevent us from providing a state-of-the-art technological solution.

### Benefits of the New Version

- :rocket: Increased performance
- :milky_way: Wider functionality
- :gemini: Identical programming interfaces to our best API
- :thumbsup: Higher quality of support and service

### Milestones

Feature development has already stopped for the [old version](https://github.com/dxFeed/dxfeed-c-api) of dxFeed C
API.

We expect the new repository to go into production in Q4’2023.
At the same time, the old version will be considered deprecated, and at the end of 2024, we plan to end the service.
If you’re already our customer and have difficulty with a future transition, please contact us via
our [customer portal](https://jira.in.devexperts.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/122).

### Future Development

Features planned with **high priority**:

* Add unit tests and conduct different types of testing
* Add necessary entities for more convenient API
  usage ([IPF](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/ipf/InstrumentProfile.html), [TimeSeriesEventModel](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/model/TimeSeriesEventModel.html), [OrderBookModel](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/model/market/OrderBookModel.html), [GetTimeSeriesPromise](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeed.html#getTimeSeriesPromise-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Object-long-long-),
  etc.)
* Provide more samples
* Provide performance test results along with a comparison with the old API version

---
Features planned for the **next stage**:

* Implement a model
  of [incremental updates](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-services/real-time-data-services/-net-api-incremental-updates.html)
  in Java API and add it to С/C++ API
* Implement OrderBookModel with advanced logic (e.g., OnNewBook, OnBookUpdate, OnBookIncrementalChange) in Java API and
  add it to C/C++ API
* Add samples or implement a convenient API
  for [Candlewebservice](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-services/aggregated-data-services/candlewebservice.html)

### Migration

To help you rewrite the existing API calls, we’ve prepared [samples](#samples) demonstrating how to work with the new
API and how several functionalities are implemented. More examples will follow. The table below shows the sample mapping
between the old and new versions.

Our support team on our [customer portal](https://jira.in.devexperts.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/122) is
ready to answer any questions and help with the transition.

### Implementation Details

We use [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) technology and specially
written code that *wraps* Java methods into native ones
to get dynamically linked libraries for different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) based on
the [latest Java API package](https://dxfeed.jfrog.io/artifactory/maven-open/com/devexperts/qd/dxfeed-api/).

Then, the resulting dynamic link library (dxFeed Graal-native) is used through
C [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) (application binary interface),
and we write programming interfaces that describe our business model (similar to Java API).

As a result, we get a full-featured, similar performance as with Java API.
Regardless of the language, writing the final application logic using API calls will be very similar (only the syntax
will be amended, *"best practices"*, specific language restrictions)

Below is a scheme of this process:
